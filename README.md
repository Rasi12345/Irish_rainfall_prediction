# Irish rainfall prediction using XGB and Random Forest Regressor
This research discusses many aspects that contribute to rainfall prediction. Despite, advancements in technology, it is quite difficult to predict accurate weather. As we all know how it is important in our dayto-day life to check the weather before going outside these days. In Ireland, the unpredictability of the weather is very likely, but particularly accurate rainfall prediction is very much difficult. The research is based on data which is gathered from the Met Eireann website which is readily available on the Kaggle website from 1990 to 2020. An exploratory analysis was conducted to assess the most predictive variables for rainfall prediction. Weather prediction is done previously using many techniques like observing wind, changes in air pressure, and computerized methods. As a result, this assignment aims to use various data mining and analytics techniques to obtain useful information trying to predict the accurate rainfall prediction for Irish weather. In this paper, we have used the CRISP-DM model and its six methodologies are implemented to get the rainfall predictions. Based on the comparison of various machine learning models, we concluded that Random forest and XGB boost are the best performing models for our prediction.
